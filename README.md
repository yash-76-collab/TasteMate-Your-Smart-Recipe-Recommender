TasteMate: Your Smart Recipe Recommender
This project is a full-stack machine learning web application that recommends recipes based on user interactions and preferences. It uses a hybrid filtering approach combining content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to suggest food recipes.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Food.com Recipes and User Interactions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions)
- **Files Used**:
  - `RAW_recipes.csv`: Contains over 230K recipes with ingredients and steps
  - `RAW_interactions.csv`: Over 1 million user ratings and interactions

Please follow these steps:

1. Download the `RAW_recipes.csv` file directly from the Kaggle dataset:
   - ðŸ”— [Download Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions?select=RAW_recipes.csv)
   - You must have a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) account to access the download.

2. Place the downloaded file in the following folder structure:
data/RAW_recipes.csv

3. The `filtered_data.csv` will be **automatically generated by the script** when you run the preprocessing code. No need to download it manually.

Note: Please ensure the `data` folder exists in your project root before running the code.


## Machine Learning Approach

### Preprocessing
- Cleaned recipe text fields (name, ingredients, steps)
- Removed missing values and duplicates
- Encoded features for modeling

### Recommendation Models
- **Content-Based Filtering**
  - TF-IDF vectorization on ingredients
  - Cosine similarity for recipe-to-recipe matching
- **Collaborative Filtering**
  - User-item rating matrix
  - KNN-based nearest neighbor recommendations

### Hybrid System
- Combines content and collaborative scores for more accurate results

## Deployment

- **Frontend**: React.js (deployed on Vercel)
  - [Frontend GitHub Repository](https://github.com/The-Cow-addict/data-mining-project)
- **Backend**: FastAPI (deployed on Render)
  - [Backend GitHub Repository](https://github.com/The-Cow-addict/data-mining-project-backend)
- **Live App**: [https://data-mining-project-eight.vercel.app/](https://data-mining-project-eight.vercel.app/)
